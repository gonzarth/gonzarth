I'm experienced with MATLAB and Python to do Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence modeling. Usually I'm able to work on any sort of data analysis and data processing, but most of the time I'm dealing with time-series data, both in academia and industry. Currently I'm working as a Data Scientist for a tech company in Brazil, doing ML modeling in the context of Supply Chain. For cloud computing I use AWS.
