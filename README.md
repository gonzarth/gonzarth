### Hey, I'm Arthur 👋

I'm an award-winning data scientist based in Brazil. Currently I'm pursuing a master's degree in computational neuroscience at the Federal University of Pará. 

- 🔭 &nbsp; I’m currently working as a **Data Scientist @ Wire Analytics** (a small project of mine).
- 🌱 &nbsp; I’m looking to collaborate in **Anything on ML and/or AI**.
- 😄 &nbsp; Pronouns: **he/him**.

And in case you're wondering, most of the time I work with Python for statistical analysis, machine learning modeling and AI, as well as scripting. For cloud services I'm using GCP.
