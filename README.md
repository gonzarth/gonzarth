### Hey, I'm Arthur ðŸ‘‹

I'm an award-winning data scientist based in Brazil. Currently I'm pursuing a master's degree in computational neuroscience at the Federal University of ParÃ¡.

Despite loving my job as a data scientist, I also love to do software engineering with Ruby & Rails. For machine learning and statistical analysis stuff I use Python, and for deployment I like to rely on <a href="https://render.com">Render.com</a> (but I also use GCP whenever its necessary).
