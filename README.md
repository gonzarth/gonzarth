### Hey, I'm Arthur ðŸ‘‹

I'm an award-winning data scientist based in Brazil. Currently I'm pursuing a master's degree in computational neuroscience at the Federal University of ParÃ¡.

And in case you're wondering, most of the time I work with Python for statistical analysis, machine learning modeling and AI, as well as scripting. For cloud services I'm using GCP.
