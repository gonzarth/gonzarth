### Hey, I'm Arthur ðŸ‘‹

***

I'm an award-winning data scientist and programmer based in Brazil. I hold a Master's Degree in Neuroscience, with focus on Artificial Intelligence, by the Federal University of ParÃ¡. Currently I'm working as a Machine Learning Engineer @ Data H, doing ML modeling in the context of Supply Chain.

I solve problems ranging from back-end development to machine learning engineering. Usually I'm able to work on any en-to-end data science project, but for most of the time I've been dealing with time series modeling both in academia and industry.
