I'm experienced with Python and R do Machine Learning and AI modeling. Usually I'm able to work on any sort of data analysis and data processing, but most of the time I'm dealing with time-series data, both in academia and industry. Currently I'm working as a Data Scientist for a tech company in Brazil, doing ML modeling in the context of Supply Chain. For cloud computing I use AWS.
