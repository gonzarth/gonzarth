### Hey, I'm Arthur ðŸ‘‹

***

I'm an award-winning data scientist and programmer based in Brazil. I hold a Master's Degree in Neuroscience, with focus on Artificial Intelligence, by the Federal University of ParÃ¡. Currently I'm working as a Machine Learning Engineer @ Data H, doing ML modeling in the context of Supply Chain.

I solve problems spanning from back-end development (mostly with ruby on rails) to machine learning engineering (using python). I'm usually able to work on any end-to-end data science project, although most of the time I've been dealing with time series modeling in both academia and industry.
