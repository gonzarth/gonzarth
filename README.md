### Hey, I'm Arthur ðŸ‘‹

***

I'm an award-winning data scientist based in Brazil. I hold a Master's Degree in Neuroscience, with focus on Artificial Intelligence, by the Federal University of ParÃ¡. Currently I'm working as a Data Scientist @ Data H, doing ML modeling in the context of Supply Chain.

I'm experienced with MATLAB and Python to do Machine Learning and Deep Learning modeling. Usually I'm able to work on any sort of end-to-end data science project, but most of the time I'm dealing with time-series modeling, both in academia and industry.
