### Hey, I'm Arthur ðŸ‘‹

***

I'm an award-winning data scientist based in Brazil. I hold a Master's Degree in Neuroscience, with focus on Artificial Intelligence, by the Federal University of ParÃ¡. Currently I'm working as a Machine Learning Engineer @ Data H, doing ML modeling in the context of Supply Chain.

I'm experienced with Machine Learning and Deep Learning modeling. Besides my work as a data scientist, I also love to do software engineering. Usually I'm able to work on any sort of end-to-end data science project, but most of the time I'm dealing with time-series modeling, both in academia and industry. For cloud service provisioning I rely on Serverspace (but I can use other providers as needed).
